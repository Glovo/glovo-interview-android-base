# glovo-interview-android-base

This repository contains all the dependencies that you might need to use during the Glovo Live Coding interview.
Please build this empty project to have all the dependencies cached on your machine before the interview starts,
so the process will be smoother. :)

For the Live Coding interview, you will be invited to a private Glovo repository. You must have
[2 Factor Authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)
enabled in your account in order to access to the repository.

Keep in mind that 2FA involves updating your
[command line Git configuration](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication#using-two-factor-authentication-with-the-command-line)
as well.

Both this project and the one we will use in the interview need Gradle to be set up to use JDK 17.
From Android Studio Flamingo (2022.2.1), the Studio IDE is bundled with it. But if you are using a
different version of Android Studio, please make sure it is using JDK 17. You can check if it is 
correctly set by going in Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment \> Build Tools > Gradle > 
Gradle JDK.

Make sure to have everything ready before the interview, so you can focus on the challenge instead of wasting time
configuring account and environment.

Good luck :)
